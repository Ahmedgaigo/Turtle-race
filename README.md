Turtle Race Game

This is a fun and interactive Turtle Race game implemented using Python and the Turtle module. The objective of the game is to bet on the winning turtle and see if your prediction comes true. The turtles will race across the screen, and the first turtle to reach the end will be declared the winner.

The game features include:

1. Screen setup: The game window is set to a size of 500x400 pixels, providing a suitable canvas for the race.

2. Background picture: The game screen is decorated with a background image, adding visual appeal to the game.

3. Turtle selection: There are four turtles available to choose from, each represented by a different color (red, yellow, green, and black). Players can make their bet by selecting the color of the turtle they believe will win the race.

4. Racing mechanism: Once the bet is made, the race begins. Each turtle moves forward a random distance between 0 and 10 pixels in each iteration. The race continues until one of the turtles reaches the end of the screen.

5. Determining the winner: When the race concludes, the program checks the position of each turtle. If a turtle reaches the end of the screen, the game declares the winner based on the color of the turtle. If the winning turtle matches the player's bet, they are declared the winner; otherwise, they lose the bet.

To play the game, run the script and follow the prompts to make your bet on the winning turtle. Watch the race unfold and see if you can guess the correct outcome.

Have fun playing the Turtle Race Game and may the fastest turtle win!
